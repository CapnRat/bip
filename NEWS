09-12-2007: Bip has now two types of users "admins" and normal user. Some
commands are reserved to admin. Add a admin = true; statement in your config
(in user block) accordingly.

29-10-2007: Certificate validation change. In "basic" mode, expired
certificates are now accepted as long as they are in store (therefore trusted).
This makes the basic mode be more SSH like. Some extreme security zealots might
want to be warned.

02-09-2007: as of now log parameters go in the user {} statment. This brakes
every config and there is no backwrads compatibility as of now.
Lots of internal changes, expect crashes.
