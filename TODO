Before release:
- SSL certificate verification
- keep invites when detached ?
- allow global (or per net ?) IP filtering
- /bip command for admin (at least rehash, jump, ...)
- check why log_mode doesn't add closing bracket...
- bug: bip using 100% cpu when reconnecting (to SSL only ?)

TODO:
- DCC proxying...
- crypt logs

- use gnutls
- MODE #channel and WHO #channel on join
