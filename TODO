Hi Arnaud,

is it possible to implement a secondary nick option? If I'm connected
directly to IRC, it would be great if BIP fallbacked to the secondary
nickname.

I saw that BIP uses the default nickname + a "`". Where could I change
it to default nickname + "_"?

Thanks a lot for your help.
Best regards,
Whoopie
